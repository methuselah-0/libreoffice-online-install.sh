# Written by: methuselah-0
# License: GPLv3.
# Rationale: created for several reasons; 1. as a bash-script coding exercise 2. because builds were not working so I tried to make it failsafe by having source-files set to known-to-work commits 3. I wanted a more commented version to better understand the installation process.

### Post-Install Config - Certificates ###
# loolwsd looks in /etc/loolwsd for the self generated ssl certificates which are actually in ./etc/loolws. This can be fixed in at least 3 ways:
#
# Method 1. Link existing certificates there. Had permissions issue so can't use for now.
#sudo mkdir -p /etc/loolwsd
#ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/$mydomain/chain.pem /etc/loolwsd/ca-chain.cert.pem
#ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/$mydomain/privkey.pem /etc/loolwsd/key.pem
#ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/$mydomain/cert.pem /etc/loolwsd/cert.pemn
#
# Method 2. Generate new keys and sign them. Has drawback of not being signed by trusted authority.
# openssl genrsa -out /etc/loolwsd/key.pem 4096
#openssl req -out /etc/loolwsd/cert.csr -key /etc/loolwsd/key.pem -new -sha256 -nodes -subj "/C=DE/OU=cloud.selfhosted.xyz.com/CN=cloud.selfhosted..xyz/emailAddress=hostmaster@selfhosted.xyz"
#openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /etc/loolwsd/cert.csr -signkey /etc/loolwsd/key.pem -out /etc/loolwsd/cert.pem
#openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /etc/loolwsd/cert.csr -signkey /etc/loolwsd/key.pem -out /etc/loolwsd/ca-chain.cert.pem 
#
# Method 3: copy all certs and keys to where you want them and set correct location and permissions on the copy.
# This is because lool user doesn't have access rights to /etc/letsencrypt. Works! :D
mkdir -p $loo/etc/mykeys
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/$mydomain/* $loo/etc/mykeys # Make cronjob for this?
sed -i "s/\/etc\/loolwsd/$loo\/etc\/mykeys/g" $loo/loolwsd.xml
echo "Using LetsEncrypt keys that was copied from /etc/letsencrypt/live/$mydomain/* to $mydomain/etc/mykeys. Remember to copy and overwrite these certificates with renewd ones and to sudo chown -R lool:lool $loo/etc/mykeys"
# Fix file ownership.
chown -R lool:lool /etc/loolwsd
# Now loolwsd should run without SSL errors.
# Now you should be able to run loolwsd as an unprivilledged user (not root). For running "manually" see REAL RUN and systemd unit below.
echo "make run will now be issued issued from "$loo" as user lool. You must kill this process from another terminal" && sleep 5
cd $loo && sudo -u lool bash -c "make run"


### 2.3. BUILDING LIBREOFFICE ON-LINE CLIENT (LOLEAFLET) ###
#
# Section reference: https://github.com/LibreOffice/online/blob/master/wsd/README
#
# Note: building loleaflet is not needed right now since we ran make run above
# Also we will use nextcloud to connect to loolwsd.
#
###
#
#echo "Next up, LibreOffice Online Web-Client JavaScript Component - loleaflet."
#echo "Please check the README file found in online/loleaflet as some common build errors are addressed there. This is also linked in the Notes section."
#beep && sleep 5
# Some NODEJS dependencies
# Install npm (provided by node.js package) if not installed already.
#apt-get install nodejs -y
# Install dependencies needed to build loleaflet through npm.
#npm install -g jake
#echo "Check whether npm is at least version 3.0."
#npm -v
# If not upgrade npm.
#npm install -g npm
#npm -v
# Create a symbolic link for node.js as the makefile looks for node.js in /usr/bin/node.
#ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
# Double fix file ownerships.
#chown -R lool:lool {$loc,$loo,$poco}

### REAL RUN OF WSD ###
#
# This is the alternative method of make run above.
#
# If you want to do the 'make run' yourself, you need to set up a minimal chroot system, and directory for the jails. 
#
# Note: there will be forking issues "Failed to fork child processes." unless loolforkit has cap_sys_chroot cap_mknod cap_fowner variables set.
#
# Fix this and you can uncomment the code below to do it this way.
#
